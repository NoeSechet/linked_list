# linked_list Epitech first years Workshop

In this workshop we looked at how to make linked list and use them in a very simple SFML application (only displaying a list of circles).

I used .cpp files but I tried to only use C fonctionalities as the first years were only allowed to use the CSFML (C version of SFML).

In the "cpp_version" folder I create the exact same application but with a few differences.
For example, using "sf::Shape" in the "node_t" structure instead of using "void *" to store the circle entities in the linked_list.
